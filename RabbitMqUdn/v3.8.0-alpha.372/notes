Test out:
1. Try and make stale follower a leader
2. Create multiple quorum queues, partion and heal: see if distribution is ok

## 1. Stale follower election
Passed all tests. Cannot make a stale follower win an election.

## 2. Create multiple quorum queues, partion and heal
Execute the create-multiple-qq.sh script to create 21 queues with leaders distributed equally
across three nodes.

Then perform:
$ blockade partition rabbitmq1
$ blockade join

See the distribution of leaders is concentrated.
